= Changes Log =

== 1.0: No longer a beta :) ==
 * Added Wix/MSI setup, with dotNetInstaller boot strapper
 * Initialized Status -> Rename to Ready
 * Fix: When app was loaded, prev file did not show the loop bounderies ("bar"). Only after playing the file, it then shows up.
 * Major bug fix: Stopping the audio was not done correctly and caused threading issues (lockups) and/or crashes.

== 0.6 (Beta 6): ==
 * FLAC Playback Support
 * (Core) Fixed: WMA playback was broken
 * (Core) Equalizer fine tuning: Lo (Bass) more pronounced

== 0.5 (Beta 5): == 

 * Bug fixes (Core) - Application sometimes crashed when a file was loaded, Stop/Terminate playback logic was incorrect
 * Bug fixes (UI) - Cancel Write mode did not work properly, it caused the preset to be re-selected loosing the current settings, Current Up/Down controls did not transition properly (e.g. decrementing the seconds below zero did not affect minutes)
 * Added logging using NLog (log file resides in %LOCALAPPDATA%\PracticeSharp\Practice#.log)
 * Added central exception handlers that log the exceptions and show a proper dialog

== 0.4 (Beta 4): == 
 * Equalizer controls
 * Keyboard shortcuts
 * Fix: SoundTouch DLL now works properly with SoundTouchSharp in Release Mode
 * Fix: Flickers, Tab Order, Tool Tips, cosmetics

== 0.3 (Beta 3): == 
 * Added playback support for WMA
 * Integrated with new version NAudio 64392. NAudio has incoporated WMA support that was developed in Practice# (based on original code from Idael Cardaso)
 * Bug fixes, mainly stability issues with preset saving and when application was shut down
 * All Playback initialization and termination fully moved into the audio processing thread (not done on main UI thread any longer)
 * Improved playback hiccups - Mainly due to synchronous events from PracticeSharpLogic to MainForm. Now PracticeSharpLogic events are asynchronous.
 * Added support for a command line argument - the filename (to allow running Practice# from command line or through a future shell extension)
 * Code clean up

== 0.2 (Beta 2): ==
 * Added playback support for Ogg Vorbis (using Vorbis#, based one some ideas from DragonOgg)
 * Added a new library/NAudio plugin to support Ogg Vorbis in NAudio (Standalone TestApp also available)
 * Fixed some issues with play back 
 * Changed default volume to 50%
 * Reset all settings/UI Controls when loading files. New files that have never been used, have no presets and as a result all the previous file information stays (Tempo, Pitch, Volume, Presets)

== 0.1 (Beta 1): ==
 * Improved Updated Version checker, it now works asynchronously thus not blocking the application on load
 * Fixed: The playTimeTrackBar was jumping slightly back and forth when changing presets
 * NAudio: Using latest version (63489)
