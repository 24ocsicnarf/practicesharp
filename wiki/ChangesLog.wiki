(Coming soon)
 * Equalizer controls
 * Keyboard shortcuts
 * Fix: SoundTouch DLL now works properly with SoundTouchSharp in Release Mode
 * Fix: Flickers, Tab Order, Tool Tips, cosmetics

== Beta 3: == 
 * Added playback support for WMA
 * Integrated with new version NAudio 64392. NAudio has incoporated WMA support that was developed in Practice# (based on original code from Idael Cardaso)
 * Bug fixes, mainly stability issues with preset saving and when application was shut down
 * All Playback initialization and termination fully moved into the audio processing thread (not done on main UI thread any longer)
 * Improved playback hiccups - Mainly due to synchronous events from PracticeSharpLogic to MainForm. Now PracticeSharpLogic events are asynchronous.
 * Added support for a command line argument - the filename (to allow running Practice# from command line or through a future shell extension)
 * Code clean up

 * Added a new library/NAudio plugin to support Ogg Vorbis in NAudio (Standalone TestApp also available)
 * Fixed some issues with play back
